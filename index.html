			<div class="AboutMe">
				<p><span class="Intro">Hi, I’m Golli.</span> I’m a user experience architect and consultant to startups and small businesses. I’m passionate about making things fun and easy to use for everyday people.</p>
				<p>I love to learn and aspire to give back as much as I have received. I mentor UX students and advise teams at The Starter League. I also advise teams at events like Booth Startup Launch and Startup Weekend.</p>
				<p>I’m always trying new things and exploring new hobbies. Passions at the moment include improv comedy, running, and traveling. I love meeting new people and working with other smart creatives on side projects. This site is in progress. In the meantime, you should <a href="mailto:golli@ghashemian.com" target="_blank">get in touch with me!</a></p>
